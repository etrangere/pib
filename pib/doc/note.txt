PRODUCT VISION BOARD CHECKLIST
Use the following checklist to ensure that your Product Vision Board is effective.
VISION
☑
☑
☑
☑
☑
☑
Inspiring: Describes the positive change the product should create.
Shared: Unites people, creates alignment, and facilitates collaboration.
Ethical: Gives rise to a product that does not cause any harm to people and the planet.
Concise: Easy to understand and remember.
Ambitious: Describes a big, audacious goal that might never be fully reached.
Enduring: Provides guidance for the next five to ten years and is free from assumptions about the solution.
TARGET GROUP
☑
☑
☑
Clear: Use relevant qualities like demographics and behavioural attributes to characterise the target group.
Specific: You can tell if somebody is included in the target group or not.
Cohesive: The members of a target group share similar attributes, e.g., age, lifestyle, disposable income. If that’s not
the case, then break up the target group and form several subgroups.
NEEDS
☑
☑
☑
☑
Outcome-
based:
Specific: Capture the reason why people would want to use the product. Describe what success looks like from the
perspectives of the users and customers.
The needs are detailed enough so that you can validate them.
Focused: Concentrate on the main problem/benefit, the main reason for people to use the product.
Prioritised: If you do identify several needs, prioritise them according to their importance for the target group.
PRODUCT
☑
☑
☑
☑
Type:
It’s clear what kind of product you want to offer, for example, mobile app on Android and iOS
Differentiated: The aspects of your product that make it stand out, set it apart from alternative offerings are stated.
Focused: There are no more than five features.
Big: The features are coarse-grained product capabilities; no epics and user stories!
BUSINESS GOALS
☑
☑
☑
Outcome-
based:
Specific: The desired business benefits, the company’s reason for investing in the product, are clearly described, for
example, revenue, brand equity, cost savings.
The business goals are detailed; state rough targets if possible.
Prioritised: If more than one business goal is identified; order according to business impact.
BONUS CRITERIA
☑ Needs-first:
☑ Validated:
☑ Adaptive:
☑ Shared:
Start with the needs after you’ve captured the vision especially when you create a new strategy—be it for
a brand-new product or for an existing one.
The strategy captured on the product vision board does not contain any major hypotheses and risks. It has
been successfully validated, for instance, by interviewing and observing target users, building throwaway
prototypes, and carrying out competitive analysis.
The product vision board is regularly inspected and adapted, at least once every three months as a rule of
thumb.
The key stakeholders and development team members have a shared understanding of the product vision
board contents and support the decisions captured on it.
